Comments/To do


- compareabpos and compareaepos are just the reverse of each other

- Two high-quality matches smoothly connected (no low qv, no low coverage region in between)
Problem: Sequence of sets of indices. Identify gradients in set element

- Write function similar to profileCoverage that checks for k-coverage. This should take care of both chimeric segments 
and "homologous recombination" issue

- When checking for hinges, line 458. When alignment ends in +-300 interval around rising/falling edge, should check whether
the actual read extends longer. 

- Before doing the hinge test (say, at a rising edge), you should check whether there is any read that extends from the 
annotation event until the end of the (effective) read. If there isn't, place a hinge anyway. Otherwise, do the current test



- explain trim_overlap and addType2. Variables are very confusing
